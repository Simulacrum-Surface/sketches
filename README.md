# sketches
</br>
</br>
I'll upload some sketches from time to time because there is nothing better than a good laugh. </br>
By the way, im fully aware that this stuff is far away from "serious" drawing, those sketches are made "accidentally" in my spare time :D</br></br>
Hope you like it :)

You'll find the High-Res files in the subfolder. The .png files are uploaded with one purpose: You dont have to pull the stuff without knowing what it is.
</br></br>
Oh, by the way: If you want to publish some of the stuff on your blog or what ever, please be kind and inform me. There should be no problem in using this sketches, you dont even have to mention me (... but it would be nice, tbh), as long as your blog/company/whatever doesnt support this closed-source-pull-money-out-of-everything-philosophy.
